AWS Solution Architect

Region and AZ 
 AWS Region - it is cluster of data centre
 AZ  - mulitple datacentre in same AZ 
 Data centre
 Edge location

IMP point Region and AZ 
 1. each region have multiple AZ minumum 2 max 6 , usually 3
 2. how to choose a region ?
    1. Compliance
    2. Proximity/Latency
    3. Available service in a region 
    4. Pricing - it vary region to vary



IAM - Identity access management
   IAM Groups
   IAM USers
   IAM policies
   IAM Roles

IMP Point for IAM
  1. 1 group can have mulitple user of same type like developer
  2. 1 user can be shared betweeen multiple group
  3. IAM Permission to User and group is given through json document called policies .
  4. IAM roles is permission for AWS services , not for physical person common roles are for EC2 and LAMBDA
  5. IM SECURITY TOOL - IAM credential report,advisior

MFA devices in AWS ?
    1. virtual MFA devices  
    2. Universal 2nd factor security key 
    3. hardware key 


how can user access AWS ?
    1. console
    2. CLI protected by access key
    3. AWS SDK  - for code , protected by access key
    ACCESS KEY: its like a password
        ACCESS KEY ID  =  username
        SECREY ACCESS KEY  =  password
    4. AWSclouldshell - available for few regions only


EC2
===================

1. Intstance type
   General Purpose  - balanced between  , compute , memory , networking - T series
   Compute intensive - C series
   memory intensive - R series
   Storage  - I and D series

Security group
    1. can be attached to multiple Intstance
    2. its good to maintain one seperate security group for ssh access
    3. if your APPLICATION is not accessed(time out) , its security group issue.
    4. if application refused error , its application launched error

Classic port to know ?
 1. 22 - SSH - login to linux Intstance
 2. 21 - FTP - file upload into file shared
 3. 22 - SFTP 
 4. 80 - HTTP - access unsecured website
 5. 443 - HTTPS -  access secured website
 6. 3389 - RDP(remote desktop protocol) - log into windows Intstance

      pay for what you use 
      billing per second
      high cost but no upfront payment
      short term
      No long term commitment
  2. Reserved Instance
     upto 75% discount
     booked for 1 year or 3 yrs only
     discounted price
     used for database
     pricing depend on upfront amount
     reserve specific instance
  3. convertible reserved instance
     upto 54% discount
     change instance type
  4. sceduled reserved instance
  5. spot instance
    cheapest
    90% discount
    loose the instance
    workload which are resilient to failure like image processing,data anaylsis , batch job
    define max spot price
    not suitable for critical job
    one-time/persistent request for spot instance
  6. EC2 Dedicated Host
     compliance requirment
     use your existing  server-bound software Licence .
     3 year period reservation
  7. EC2 Dedicate instance
  8. spot fleets
        set of sopt instance  + (optional) on demand , define pools : instance type , os ,AZ
        strategies to decide spot instance from pool
           lowestprice
           deversified
           capacity optimized

Placement group of EC2
  1. Cluster - all ec2 are in same rack same AZ for low Latency
  2. spread - 
     spread across multiple AZ and hardware ,
      limited to 7 EC2 per AZ
      critical application since hardware for each ec2 is different
  3. partition - 
       spread partions in multiple AZ , 
       each partion can have mulitple ec2 , 
       max 7 partition per az , 
       no rack sharing

  ram state is written in file in  root ebs and encrypted
  supported c,m,r series
  ram size less than 150GB
  available for ondemand , reserved
  hibernate less than 60 days

EC2 Nitro?
 can be used for high performing EBS upto 64k iops
 new vertulisation technology
 better underlying security
 bare metal instance types

 EC2 vCPU?
   virtual vCPU
   1 core is having 2 thread so if 4 cpu == 8 vcpu 
   multithreading
   decrease cpu as well threads per cpu for decrease licencing cost

EC2 - Capacity Reservation?
  no need for 1 or 3 yr reservation
  for which AZ
  number of instance
  instance attribute

EBS - elastic block Storage?
  can be deleted if ec2 instance termnated 
  can attached multiple ebs with one ec2
  attached and detach ebs from one ec2 to another within  same az
  preserve root valume also if you wanted to retain data if ec2 terminate
  EBS Volumne Type?
    General purpose SSD - g2/g3 -16k iops
      cost effective , low Latency
      system boot valume , virtual desktop , developemtn env 
      g2 - storage and iops are linked togeater
      g3 - storage and iops are independent
    Provisioned IOPS?
      good for usecase required more iops
      database workloads more thn 16k iops
      storage and iops are independent
      io1/io2  - 64k

    provisioned - high throughput regardless of storage 
  storage tier ?
    standard
    infrequent access 


Public IP / Private IP / ElasticIP

1. public is used to do ssh
2. stop and start will change public ipv4
3. to avoid changing public ip again and again use eplastic ip
4. max 5 elastic ip is available per account , ask aws for more
5. elastic ip can be map to only one instance .
6. not good practice in design to use elastic ip , better to use dns and load lbalancer


Load Balancer and ASG 

Classic lbalancer
  support TCP(layer4),HTtp and https(layer 7)
  fixed ip for lbalancer

Appplication lbalancer
  support http,https
  mulitple target groups
  health checks are target level
  based on route string like patform=mobile/desktop we can redirect request to different target group
  true ip of client will be part of header X-forwarded-for , and port in X-forwarded-port
  used for ECS , lambda function

Network lbalancer
  layer 4
  tcp and udp 
  handle million request per second 
  low latency than alb 
  nlb has one static ip per AZ
  save cookies for session data

   provide auto scalling feature based on some threshold
   provide backup facility , transaction log backup
   it provide multiAZ , and region support
   used for unpredictable load
   support upto 5 read replica and its eventually consistent
   there is cost associated with network if read replica in another region
   TDE(trnsport data encryption) is not supported by postgreSQL
   For single AZ to Multi AZ ?
     zero downtime operation (no need to stop DB)
     just click on modify for the database and set to multiAZ 
        db will create a snapshot of master , and restore in new database 
    RDS Encryption ?
      encryption at rest , using aws-kms
      if master is not encrypted then replica cant be encrypted 
      encrypting RDS backup
        snapshot of encrypted db is encrypted 
        snapshot of unencrypted db is unencrypted 
        copy snapshot of unencrypted snapshot  to encrypted

 it aws managed service in cloud
 much faster than rds sql and postgresql
  one master m, 15 read replica or serverless used for unpredictable load
  auto expanding
  support cross region replication
  shared storage volumne so that read replica can read 
  backtrack feature  - if you want to go back to specfic time of database to restore
  Client connect to writer endpoint to write in master , and client connect to "reader endpoint" to read from read replica that will do load balancing and connect to read replca ?
  security is same as rds 
     encryption at rest using kms
     encryptiopn in-flight using ssl
     ssh not allowed
     setup security group for public and proivate access at db level 
  create custom endpoints for different workload managment for read read replicas
  Aurora multimaster design available , all instance will be used for read and write
  global aurora - where we can setup secondary cluster with read only , if main cluster goes down we can promote secondary clsuter as master

ElasticCache
it doestnt support iam authentication
iam polices are supported aws api level only
Lazy loading. As the name implies, lazy loading is a caching strategy that loads data into the cache only when necessary. It works as described following. Amazon ElastiCache is an in-memory key-value store that sits between your application and the data store (database) that it accesses.
Redis and memchache
  Redis 
    its lkike database chache
    multi-az failover
    backup restore

Route53 - dns 
 its global service 
 route53 dns type :
 A type -  map hostname to ipv4
 AAAA type - hostname to ipv6
 CNAME - hostnam to other hostname - non root domain ?
 Alias - hostnam to AWS Resource -  work for both root and non root domain , free of charge , health check ?
 TTL -> it is used for cachhing the result
 Route53 routing policy 
   Simple -> route53 can return 1 ip or multiple ip
   wighted -> define the wieght for end point to return the no of request , health check available
   Latency -> redirect request to ip with least latency
   Failover -> primary instance with health check mandatory and secondary instance 
   Geolocation -> all traffic coming from UK should go specific IP
   Geoproximity -> set bias value to decide the resource proximity 
   Multi Value ->

VPC
=====================================
Subnet ipv4
    AWS reserve 5 ips in each Subnet
    if you need 29 ips for instrance what subnet you will use ?
        /26 , since 32-26 = 6 which is 64 -5 > 29 not /27 which is 32 - 5 < 29
  

Internet gateway
    it is used to provide internet connectivity to aws resoruces  (IG and Route table)
    one IG can map to one VPC and viceversa
    it will not allow    

NAT Network address translation
    allow instance in private subnet to access internet
    must be launched in public subnet
    must have elastic ip attached to it
    not highly available
    must disable source and destination check ?


NAT Gateway

    setup nat gatway in each AZ for high availablity

DNS Resolution in VPC
    1.enableDnsSupport
        default = true
    2. enableDnsHostName
        default= false
        if true , it assign hostname to EC2 instance if it has a public.
    if we use  custom dns domain name in private zone in route 53 , need to enable both setting ?

NACL - Network Access control List
    NACL are like firewall  which control trsffix in or to subnet
    one NACL per subnet
    small rule number will get more precedence
    stateless - outgoing traffic must be explicitrly allowed by rule
